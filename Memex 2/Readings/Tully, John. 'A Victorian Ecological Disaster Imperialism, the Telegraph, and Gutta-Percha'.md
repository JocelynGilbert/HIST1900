Tully opens the article by outlining the historical setting of the development of the gutta-percha trade. He shows how the 19th-century British imperial expansion into Southeast Asia increased demand for natural resources, especially gutta-percha, which had a variety of industrial uses. Tully underscores the intricate and frequently disregarded connection between technology, imperialism, and ecology throughout the entire piece. He contends that British imperial expansion was closely related to the growth of the telegraph network and the gutta-percha trade, and that this expansion had major and enduring negative effects on the economy and the environment.

- Southeast Asia's environment was significantly impacted by the need for gutta-percha. Large numbers of trees had to be felled in order to extract gutta-percha, which resulted in habitat degradation and deforestation. The local ecosystems and the residents who depended on them suffered as a result.

- The gutta-percha trade, according to the article, is an illustration of the environmental costs associated with globalisation and imperialism. The expansion of international [[communication]] networks, which made it easier to transfer knowledge, business, and culture, was a major factor in the demand for gutta-percha. The environment and the people of Southeast Asia, however, paid a heavy price for this growth.

- "The creation and maintenance of the sprawling empires of the European powers from the lat eighteeth century was a spur to revolutionary improvements in communications technology."
