An overview of the history of underwater telegraph cable development is given at the outset of the article, detailing how early technological trials resulted in the formation of transoceanic cable networks that linked continents and changed international communication. The Eastern Telegraph Company, Cyrus Field, John Pender, and other important players in the sector are also highlighted by the authors. The authors highlight how competition between businesses and investors drove the creation and upkeep of cable networks while also examining the intricate commercial alliances and rivalries that typified the submarine cable industry. They point out that fierce competition between British and American businesses dominated the sector and frequently took the shape of legal conflicts and financial squabbles.

- Technological advancement and commercial competitiveness both contributed to the development of submarine telegraph cables. Signal attenuation and cable failures plagued early attempts with undersea cables due to technological issues. But by the 1860s, advancements in cable laying methods and insulation technology had made transoceanic telegraphy a real possibility.

- The 1930s saw a drop in submarine  telegraphy as a result of both advancing [[technology]] and shifting [[communication]] trends. Submarine cables lost some of their significance for long-distance communication with the development of radio and later satellite communication. Nonetheless, the evolution of contemporary communication networks continues to reflect the heritage of undersea telegraphy.

- The establishment of a global communication network and the increase of international trade were both key factors in the development of submarine telegraphy. Due to the almost instantaneous communication that submarine cables allowed for, journalism, trade, and diplomacy all saw significant change.

- "The british hegemony in intercontinental telegraphy enjoyed extraordinary longevity, but it was not eternal. The challenge came in part from the appearance of economically powerful rivals in international trade and politics"
