Digital, Electronic Computers: Competences & Social Necessities

Competences 

machine ratiocinatrix
	- A machine that thinks 
    
versus

nulla nunc celebrior clamorosiorque secta quam Cartesinorum

Alan Turing 

-   On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem'
    
-   How to know when to quit 
    
-   The turing machine
	-   A way to think of the problem as a series of steps 
	-   How a human computer breaks down in parts 
	-   It can compute any computable problem 
	-   Depends on boolean algebra 

Shannon again & telephone relays/exchanges

-   Combine information theory with Turing's 'universal computer' and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do

Babbage 

-   Metaphors of the silk industry 
    
-   No social necessity for it 
    
-   Parallel kinds of 'computing' devices - the analogue simulators
    
-   Kelvin's tide calculator for different points around the world
    
-   Kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simulate differential equations
    
-   the mechanisms to achieve this not developed until the 1920s.... and Vannevar Bush
    
-   Dont need computers for business, but maybe for science 

'programming' these machines:

-   literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches.
    
-   useful for scientific analysis

George Stibitz (Bell Labs) - 1937

-   Runs a demo over telephone line 

Konrad Zuse - 1936

-   Get no business success 
    
-   Flees with a Z4 on the back of the truck 

Howard Aitken

-   prof at Harvard. Had designed his own electro-mechanical calculator to help with his thesis work; proposes the machine to the military in 1937; military says nah, though its own reviewing engineer wanted it; engineer introduces Aitken to IBM & Thomas Watson (president)
    

Existing 'social necessity' good enough for electrico-mechanical calculators, not enough for all-purpose general computers

Ballistics

-   the industrialization of war over the 19th century - new types of guns (ie, field guns - cannons etc), new types of firepower
    
-   Reverend Francis Bashforth, 1864-1880 - experiments related to air drag and velocity - produces the first firing tables
    
-   US military, in aftermath of civial war, establishs testing range to train ballistic officers and work out tables for different kinds of guns

Mauchly & ENIAC

-   Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator/Computer
    
-   Memo is lost
    
-   His secretary recreates the notes 

Grace Hopper

- very imporant women! 

- United States naval officer and mathematician

- In 1949 Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp., where she designed one of the first compilers, which translated a programmer’s instructions into computer codes
