Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler's research project, "Anatomy of an AI System," explores the intricate web of materials, labour, and information flows that go into building and running an Amazon Echo smart speaker. The project intends to raise awareness of the [[technology]] unaddressed social and environmental consequences and to advance a more critical and open approach to AI research. The project is organised as a visual and textual map that traces the life cycle of an Amazon Echo, starting with the extraction of raw materials like rare earth minerals and moving through China's manufacturing process, the distribution network and shipping lanes, cloud infrastructure and data storage, the consumer's home, and interactions with the device.


“Put simply: each small moment of convenience – be it answering a question, turning on a light, or playing a song – requires a vast planetary network, fueled by the extraction of non-renewable materials, labor, and data.”
- In addition, the production of the Echo device necessitates the labour of factory workers, some of whom may put in lengthy shifts for meagre pay in hazardous conditions. The distribution and shipment of the item also has an influence on the environment in terms of carbon emissions.
