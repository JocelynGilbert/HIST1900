Kevin Driscoll examines the history of the modem and its influence on the growth of the internet and contemporary computers in his piece "The Birth of the Modem World," which was published on Slate on September 7, 2022. Driscoll starts off by recounting the early days of modem [[technology]], when users had to dial into other computers using a phone line because computers weren't yet connected to the internet. He describes how the development of bulletin board systems (BBS), the first online communities that permitted users to chat, share data, and play games, was made possible by the invention of the modem.


“The CBBS “host” computer was hooked up to a single telephone line and could handle just one user at a time. To get online, potential users needed a telephone modem and some kind of data terminal.”

-   Users required a data terminal and a telephone modem in order to access the CBBS. The data terminal was a device that allowed the user to use [[communication]] with the computer, whereas the modem was a device that allowed the computer to transmit data via a telephone line.
