Archaeology 

- Dots in the caves convey a message 
	- Thinks it relates to the digestion to the animals 

- Important to know how to medium of a message changes 

The medium is the message 

- The medium can be more important than the message itself 

- A car can be the medium - extends our ability to move 
	- The more we use it, it changes how we live 
		- We must drive to get from one place to another which was not always the case 

- Medium is something that carries something else 

- Media comes in different classes or kinds of things 

- Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think
	- Stephen Jay Gould, The Titular Bishop of Titiopolis, Natural History 90:22 1981

- To hold these old scripts is power 
	- This media is important that libraries are built to hold these and preserve them 

- Alphabet 
	- Has changed over time 
	- From the Phonecian to now all alphabet was based off them 

Ancient libraries 

- Display treasure 

The Plot 

- The medium for a message is as important as the message (both for its affordances or what it permits to write, but also for how it extends our abilities to think/see the world in new ways)
	- Wax tablets melt
		- Never made to last a long time 

- how we classify media/messages has implications for - power, control, and discipline (reflects and directs our thinking)

- writing/counting intimately connected

- ­the infrastructure for writing spills out, has impacts on society

- libraries reflect the world back to itself (for why else would extremists attack library readings & book lists?)

- ­there is no 'natural' way to organize materials in a library

Moveable type 

- Made in china 

- Made from ceramic 

- Korean moveable type from 1377 used for the Jikji 
	- The oldest book
	- Buddhist 

Melvil Dewey (1851-1931)

- Books can only be about History, Philosophy or stories

- Organizes book through decimals 
	- Dewey Decimal system 
		- Library of congress 

The Memex introduces a completely new idea :

- "associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail" - V Bush

- We can call this the 'bidirectional link' 
	- (Maggie Appleton)
	- Original idea of what hypertext was going to look like 

Hypertext

- Takes past and future documents/website that could help

- Can see articles that take from a certain article 
Plot continued

- no natural way for documents/information to be organized;

- people tried to find a 'natural' way to organize information
	- these categorizations ended up reifying the way they already believed the world to work

- in a north american context, the two big approaches hit at the same time there is massive public investment and expansion and reform of education (even the blackboard was a new idea once!)

- proximity on shelves also enables a kind of discoverability; 'serendipity' it's sometimes called: but a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms

- invention of the digital computer happens not all that long after these massive reorganizations

- the digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized

Sum it up

- the physicality of messages/books has impacts in the world

- this physicality has changed over time/ thus impacts in the world have changed

- when new classifications shift, there's a shift in power too
	- every phase of the 'internet' that we shall see involves this shift

- with digitization, messages/content had potential to be 'aware' of their relationships to other messages/content - key insight of the memex

- 'hypertext' becomes an attempt at realizing that potential, but bi-directionality not implemented

- recent trends, software like notion, roam, obsidian, enables that bi-directionality.
