Can you keep a secret?

-   Cryptology: systems for 'secret' writing
	-   Emerged in many places at once 
	-   Need a way of keeping secrets
	-   Not just what is in the message but how the message is moved 

-   Cryptanalysis: systems for revealing those secrets

-   A Code: 'variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language' - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitution

-   A Cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); 'small fixed number of substitution elements'

-   Polybius - (c 200 - c 118 BC)
	-   Polybius square 
	-   Signal torches 
	-   First position of the torch is row etc.
		-   Transmit a message

-   Caesar shift - by Julius Caesar 
	-   Write out the alphabet and shift the letter by 5 
	-   The fifth letter 

-   Al-Kindi
	-   One of the greatest philosophers 
	-   Treaties on a cryptanalysis 
	-   Works how to defeat a caesar shift for example 
	-   Languages have statistical properties 

-   Roger Bacon (13th century Europe) 
	-  describes various systems of secret writing known to him; may also have encrypted the secret of the Philosopher's Stone in the same description using a grille (piece of card with holes cut out, fits over the page, reveals words)

-   Early Modern Europe (16th to about 1800 ish)
	-  remember, intro of a new information technology in Europe (moveable type) is also a marker for this period
	-  faster circulation of ideas 
	-  new ideas around the relationship of people to God, to each other, nature of government, what is a state, anyway... all these things up for discussion
	- coinciding with the European age of discovery too…
	-   Gutenberg 
		-   Printing press 

- Francis Bacon & the Bi-Literal Cipher
	-  Can use just two letter if you do it in groups of 5 
	-   32 distinct patterns 
	-   Just uses a and b to describe all letter of the alphabet using I and J as the same and U and V as the same 

-   Nomenclators
	-   mixture of substitution ciphers and codebooks
	-   still susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependent guessing
	-   popular in diplomatic circles 1400 - to about 1800
	-   Mary Queen of Scotts- nomeclator broken, her attempt to seize power thwarted
	-   Lasting to the 19th century
