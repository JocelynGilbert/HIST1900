Telephone 

-   Two tin cans and string 
    
-   The tension on the strong allows for the waves to move across 
    
-   Competences 
	-   Telegraphy 

Dates for the 'invention' of the telephone:

-   ­1840 - Charles Page
	-   Magnet close to a wire
	-   Musical tones 
	
-   ­1854 - Charles Bourseul
	-   Describes system of paper making a breaker a circuit 

-   ­1854 - Antonio Meucci
	-   Says he had already invented it but no one could find his papers

-   ­1857 - Johann Philipp Reis
	-   Invents a device that makes and distributes sound 

-   ­1864 - Innocenzo Manzetti
	-   Claims invented telephone 

-   [[­1876 - Bell vs Gray
	-   Patents filed on the exact same day]]

-   ­1878 - Cyrille Duquet
	-   Combined multiple devices into a single hand set 

-   ­1878 - Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner

-   ­1878 - David Edward Hughes
	-   Improve transport part by putting powered grains on it 

The necessary competences 

-   18th century ear horn 
	-   Samuel peeps talked about it 
	-   Anything that could transmit sound was a telephone
    
-   Enchanted lire 
	-   Charles weep stone 
	-   Connected thread to piano 
		-   If they play on the piano upstairs the lire will play down stairs 
    
-   Charles page 
	-   Horse shoe magnet close to a wire 
	-   Varying the strength of the current could change the tone 

Follow the Money

-   the results of this kind of work implied serious financial benefits to existing telegraphy
	-   Layering the frequencies 
	-   To make it sound better 
    
-   different signals, sounding different notes, could be sent down a single wire
    
-   ie, more messages on the same physical infrastructure
    
-   such devices, if they could be built, were called harmonic telephones
    
-   string phone, megaphone, speaking tubes, ear trumps, sound resonators, wave theory of electromagnetism

missing piece

-   variable resistance
	-   M Clarac - French telegraph official - found tubes with powered carbon could be put under pressure; the amount of electrical resistance could be regulated through that pressure
		-   Can change resistance to electricity 
	-   Lord Kelvin - had earlier shown that resistance to electricity in a wire could be modified by putting the wire under tension
		-   Can do the same thing 
    
-   Theory of language 
	-   Wiring human tissue into the system 
	-   Record people singing of carbon paper

Disreputability of speaking devices

-   Amazon terk 
    
-   Mechanical terk
    
"Fearing ridicule would be attached to the idea of transmitting vocal sounds telephonically... I said nothing of this plan" - Bell

-   Bell's early patents positioned his work as a telegraphic device
	-   Had a better receiver 

-   Elisha Gray's early caveats/patents position his work more as a telephone
	-   Gray’s transmitter had a better sense of sound 

-   Frankly, who-invented-what-when is a mess of competing patents, caveats, and court cases.
    
-   And then there's the problem (for Bell and Gray) of Philip Reiss.

Reis Telephone 

-   Combines the page effect with the vibrating frame of the diaphragm 
    
-   Selling these for scientific laboratories 
    
-   He has copyright and a patent 

Gray vs. Bell 

-   Existing infrastructure 
    
-   After meeting Gray changes his telephone and it becomes basically a good working phone 
    
-   He does not do the paperwork 
    
-   Bell cannot marry the girl until he finishes the phone 
    
-   Then bell applies for a patent, but the device does not exist
    
-   The receiver worked ok; transmitter was still dodgy
    
-   Enter Thomas Edison & Emile Berliner
    
-   More legal battles.

The supervening social necessity

-   improving the economics of telegraphy
    
-   the emergence of the modern corporation
    
-   By 1877 almost 1000 telephone users 
    
-   Households didn't get into telephone till after WWII

The breaks and accelerators 

-   Theodore bell is brought in 
	-   Trying to buy back patents 
	-   Threatening to sue edison's groups 
	-   Gives bell time to build a better broadcasting device

What do you do with a telephone, anyway?

-   church services
    
-   concerts
    
-   all day news broadcasts
