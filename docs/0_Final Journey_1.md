One of the most powerful things I have learned this year is from Edwards article and how early computer bulletin board systems (BBS) influenced the culture of the early internet. Edwards' firsthand account offers a distinctive viewpoint on how BBSs were utilised to build online communities and encourage user connections.

The articles both provide insightful perspectives on how technology has changed and how it has affected society. Knowing the course's historical backdrop for computing and the social implications of its early online communities are unquestionably key learnings.
