-   By the end of the 19th century, 'networks' were not a novel idea
    
Bell: 

"In a similar manner, it is conceivable that cables of telephone wires could be laid underground, or suspended overhaed, communicating by branch wires with private dweelings, country houses, shops, manufactories... uniting them through the main cable with a central office where the wires could be connected as desired, establishing direct communication between any two places... I believe, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of the Telephone Company in different cities, and a man ...may communicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place."

(prospectus for prospective investors)

-   First Bell company founded 1875
    
-   First telephone exchange operated by Western Union's telephone subsidery
    
-   First woman central office operator: 1878, Emma Nutt
    
-   Idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879

The Strowger automatic exchange - 1892

-   Undertaker 
    
-   The wife of the competing one work in the phone exchanging giving the connection to only her husbands 
    
-   First two decades of telephony - very slow uptake (remember, I'm talking US most of the time unless I say otherwise. Good research question for you: what's the situation in Canada?)
    
-   subject to interference from other electrical sources - trolleys, telegraph wires, thunderstorms

'National Bell' becomes 'American Bell'

Upshot:
-   Hubbard & Bell are out
    
-   Theodore Vail remains
    
-   The agreement with Western Union still in force

Which breaks the agreement.
-   1884 American Bell established a long distance line between NY & Boston.
    
-   Creates a subsidiary company to do this: American Telephone & Telegraph Company
    
-   establishes a laboratory to improve long distance telephony
    
-   1888 - all the court battles around the original patents are won by Bell
    
-   Bell is making money hand over fist, even though rest of the economy is in depression
    
-   Too bad the patents just won were about to expire
    
-   Independents appear; Bell fights them with both legitimate & spurious court cases
    
-   cuts rates ridiculously where there is competition
	-   Beats out competition 

-   refuses to interconnect to other systems
    
-   buys up stocks of competitors
    
-   The cost to subscribe annually, 1890, dollars 
	-   Washington: 100 - New York: 240
	-   Philadelphia: 250 ~ Chicago: 175
	-   Paris: 18 ~ Stockholm: 20

Back to main thread:

-   long distance telephony was central to Bell's plan to survive the expiration of its patents
    
-   seemed also that Bell was directing customers to use telegraph services that it owned/had major stake in
    
-   antitrust legislation, populist politicians, interstate commerce commission: AT&T in the crosshairs
    

-   Claude Shannon shows us that electrical circuits *can perform logical operations*
    
-   Which opens the door to machines that can read instructions, perform a computation, and change their own rules based on the results of that computation.
    
-   That is to say: a digital computer.
    
-   Claude Shannon in 1948 took this idea to its logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things: 
    
-   the content
    
-   the information
    
-   'Information' is a measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how 'surprising' the next letter/sound/wave/ is.
