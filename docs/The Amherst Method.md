From the Dewey Decimal Classification system's early design in the late 19th century to its widespread acceptance by libraries all over the world, Wiegand presents a thorough history of its growth. He contends that the principles of the French Enlightenment, American Progressivism, and the Social Gospel movement, among other intellectual and cultural movements of the era, had an influence on the Dewey Decimal Classification system. 

"Dewey did acknowledge a debt to Sir Francis Bacon (who nearly three centuries earlier had hypothesized that all knowledge derived from memory, reason, and imagination, and that these three invariably produced works of history, philosphy, and belles lettres), but he failed to locate his scheme in the continuum of libraby classification history and thus generally ignored the contributions and influences of his predecessors."

But when going through different timelines in 1820 Andre Marie Ampere  contributed to the invention of the telephone by showing that a magnetic needle will move if there is an electric presence. Then is can also be said that in 1832 David Alter came up with idea of the telegraph.
