The early development of fax technology, which dates back to the middle of the 19th century, is discussed by Coopersmith in chapter 1. He says that the original fax machines were created as a means of sending photos over great distances, and that they scanned and sent images using a network of wires and revolving drums. Early fax machines were slow and unreliable, according to Coopersmith, and were mostly employed by news organisations and governmental institutions. Coopersmith also touches on how the Second World War affected the advancement of fax technology, noting how military groups made great use of fax machines to send maps and other papers. He describes how the war sparked fax technology progress and how many of the developments achieved at this time helped create the contemporary fax machine.

First patent to the first world war 
- 1843

- "changed from a possible early telegraph trajectory to a perennially promisings but underperforming technology facing an established giant."
	- economy, politics and government begin to play a role 

- the market demand was not high 
	- how can they make it enticing?

- customers want it easy and cheap
	- how can they make that happen?

- two decades before the first system could make newspapers

- still no commercial success 

- too many challenges to send a fax 

- compared to a [[telegram]], the fax took more effort, time and materials 

Brian and Bakewell
- industrializing Britian 

- harnessed electricity to control and monitor railroad track safety 

- chemical telegraph 

- other inventors also filed patents 
	- similar to [[1876]] when Bell and Gray filed for patents on the same day
	- there is also a competition of being the first who has invented it, but it seems as though each person adds a different contribution that is helpful to the overall development of the invention

- "third of the telegrpah lines in the United States unsed Bain's system"

- first telegraph line in Scotland

- short lived success 

- freezed Bain out of the American market, only using Morse's system

- Bain developed 2 fax machines 

- there was a similarity between the two machines of Bain and Bakewell 

- Bain stated that his patents covered Bakewells invention 

- Bain patented his facsimilae telegraph in 1843 

- both Bain and Bakewells machines were considered technologiacal marvels, but they were doomed as they were competing against an established telegraph technology 

France: Failed Commercialization 

- Having a technology that works is not enough to succeed commercially

- One way of gaining patrons was successfully demonstrating the technology

- "Coopersmith also touches on how the Second World War affected the advancement of fax technology, noting how military groups made great use of fax machines to send maps and other papers. He describes how the war sparked fax technology progress and how many of the developments achieved at this time helped create the contemporary fax machine."

- politics and governement enhanced the consumtion to bring the fax and the [[technology]] to where it is today
