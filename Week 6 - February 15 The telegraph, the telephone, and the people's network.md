Stock market 

- Accelerating forces 

-  Design faster has a material impact of modern web 

- Crashing markets etc. 

Multiple services emerge; multiple lawsuits 

-   Henry o’reilly in the western US; secures right to exploit Morse patents; Morse later regrets this 
	-   Because of money 

-   Cooke and Wheatstone have american patents prior to Morse 
	-   therefore he is infringing on them 

-   Alexander Bain, ‘Chemical telegraph’ (1843, similar in concept to Davy’s)

-   Computing services, technologies stringing lines side-by-side 

-   Eventually Morse in triumphant in the course 
	-   The western company eventually ends up ‘eating up’ the other companies 

Early on fax machine 

-   Elisha grey

-   Made something similar 

Extending the wires 

-   All those court battles; also vandalism, cutting of lines 

-   Morse regains control of his patents 
	-   By 1851, Morse triumphant consolidation of lines in US
	-   Only three companies still standing 
	-   By the end of 1860s only western union still standing 
	-   > 150 companies absorbed 
	-   37380 miles of cable 
	-   2250 telegraph offices 

-   A message gets repeated along the lines 

-   Would have to wait for the line to clear to send the next one 

International Telegraphy

-   1842, Morse puts an experimental cable across New York Harbour

-   1849 William O'Shaughnessy Brooke, in British-controlled India, puts an iron rod beneath/across a river, some 4200 feet & transmits a message

-   1852 Frederic Gisborne lays cable between New Brunswick and PEI

-   1854 the New York, Nefoundland and London Telegraph Company forms; by 1856 has a cable across the Gulf of St Lawrence

-   1858 the Atlantic was crossed

-   Solved the problem of getting a wire across the atlantic to transmit messages 

Cyrus field 

-   Created the first atlantic cable 

-   Took 3 weeks to load the cable 

-   The wire just stops working while out there 

-   Takes a third attempt 

-   Work from the middle to the way out 

The telegraph cable fails in a few weeks 

-   Edwin whitehouse 

-   Was experimenting trying to make the sound clear 

-   Having a person to blame rather then the technology allows for advancements to better the technology 


-   Individual states begin to realize that control of international communications matters.

-   Britain especially advantaged: control of gutta pecha, colonies around the world to control start/end of long distant lines

-   1875 President Grant explains why a French cable company was denied permission to land a cable in US: they gotta let us use their cable in return

Implications for colonialism

-   takes about 100 days to sail from London to Hong Kong

-   Marx & Engels 1848: 'The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.'

-   if distance is collapsed

-   if messages can be transmitted thousands of miles within seconds/minutes
	-   then what is to stop a state from expanding its reach?

-   (you can play with the concept of space/time in the context of the Roman world with ORBIS)

By early 20th century, there were 200 000 miles of undersea cable; GP about 27 000 tons; that means 88 million trees destroyed.
