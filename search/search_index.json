The Eastern Telegraph Company, Cyrus Field, John Pender, and other important players in the sector are also highlighted by the authors. The authors highlight how competition between businesses and investors drove the creation and upkeep of cable networks while also examining the intricate commercial alliances and rivalries that typified the submarine cable industry. They point out that fierce competition between British and American businesses dominated the sector and frequently took the shape of legal conflicts and financial squabbles.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Technological advancement and commercial competitiveness both contributed to the development of submarine telegraph cables. Signal attenuation and cable failures plagued early attempts with undersea cables due to technological issues. But by the 1860s, advancements in cable laying methods and insulation technology had made transoceanic telegraphy a real possibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>The 1930s saw a drop in submarine  telegraphy as a result of both advancing technology and shifting communication trends. Submarine cables lost some of their significance for long-distance communication with the development of radio and later satellite communication.

He shows how the 19th-century British imperial expansion into Southeast Asia increased demand for natural resources, especially gutta-percha, which had a variety of industrial uses. Tully underscores the intricate and frequently disregarded connection between technology, imperialism, and ecology throughout the entire piece. He contends that British imperial expansion was closely related to the growth of the telegraph network and the gutta-percha trade, and that this expansion had major and enduring negative effects on the economy and the environment.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Southeast Asia's environment was significantly impacted by the need for gutta-percha. Large numbers of trees had to be felled in order to extract gutta-percha, which resulted in habitat degradation and deforestation. The local ecosystems and the residents who depended on them suffered as a result.</p> </li> <li> <p>The gutta-percha trade, according to the article, is an illustration of the environmental costs associated with globalisation and imperialism. The expansion of international communication networks, which made it easier to transfer knowledge, business, and culture, was a major factor in the demand for gutta-percha.

As more computers and networks were added, new technology was created to enable quicker and more effective communication and data transfer, and as a result, it grew in size and complexity over time. The TCP/IP protocol, which is the foundation of the internet's communication system, was developed by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, two significant figures in the history of the internet. The article points out that as the internet became commercialised in the 1990s, there was a sharp rise in online activity and user numbers that has persisted to the present day.</p> <p>\u201cThe use of e-mail grew in large part because of later commercial developments, especially America Online, that made connecting to e-mail much easier than it had been at its inception.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Connecting to email was not a simple process in the early days of the internet. It was difficult for most people to access to email servers since they required technical knowledge and equipment. This changed in the 1990s with the introduction of for-profit online services like America Online (AOL). By offering a user-friendly interface that allowed individuals to connect to email servers with only a few clicks, AOL made connecting to email significantly simpler. This improved the usability of email for a larger audience, including non-techies. As a result, email usage skyrocketed in popularity and became into a commonplace communication medium.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Features/LaTeX%20Math%20Support/","title":"LaTeX Math Support","text":"<p>LaTeX math is supported using MathJax.</p> <p>Inline math looks like \\(f(x) = x^2\\).
